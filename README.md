Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Ruby
This was my first program written in Ruby. I created a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the user competes against a computer (choice randomized) and can see their score.
I also implemented a "cheat" mode in which the computer will always win (activated by typing 'cheat' and deactivated with the 'off' command).
